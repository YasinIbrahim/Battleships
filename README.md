# Battleships
Simple C# console battleships game
Notes:
- some code commented out which basically allows user to randomise grid multiple times and allows to view the CPU grid beforehand.
- quickly coded however much more room for improvement, this just demonstrates game functionality. Hopefully next commit i will create game models and better separation.
